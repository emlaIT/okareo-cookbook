### A Very Javscript Project using Okareo

## Example Project
This project is a minimalistic example of how Okareo can be used to build an E2E repo for model testing.
The approach used here can be used in any project and uses the Okareo config.yml to define model tests.

## Required Steps
To use this cookbook, you will need to modify .okareo/config.yml with appropriate scenario, and model IDs.

Once done, you can run ```okareo run``` to run the tests

To learn more, refer to [Okareo CLI Docs](https://docs.okareo.com/docs/sdk/cli).
